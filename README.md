##*CA1:Cloud Strategy and sample deployment*##

###Introduction###

In todays ever changing business climate,small business owners must be able to acess data and applications from thier computers,tablets or mobile phones,
wheather in the office,out in the field or on the road.Cloud computing provides this  anywhere access via an internet connection.As we know cloud computing
is the on-demand delivery of computing services,including applications,data storage and data processing,over the internet.Working in the cloud offers small 
business many benefits,including enhanced collaboration,easy access and fast turnaround.

2. *Current IT setup of the enterprise*

Dafin Exim is now access and store data and applications through on premise IT resources such as HDDs(Hard Disk Drive).The reasons behind their usage of on-premise are HDDs are readily 
available ,affordable ,long life span.As Dafin Exim is a growing enterprise they are running their business manually (B2C) and  hence they are not much aware of the benefits of cloud storage devices.Their computings are done by tally software. Reducing operating costs and  optimizing IT environments are very important to understanding and being  able to compare the cost models behind provisioning on-premise  and cloud-based environments.


3. *Recommendations*


Similar to a product wholesaler that purchases goods in bulk for lower price points,public cloud providers base thier business models on the mass-aquisition
of IT resources that are then made available to cloud consumers via attractively priced leasing packages.This opens the door for organizations to 
gain access to powerful infrastructure without having to purchase it themselves. A cloud delivery model represents a specific,pre-packaged combination of IT 
resources offered by a cloud provider.Three common cloud delivery models have become a widely established and formalized:
- Infrastucture-as-a-Service(IaaS)
- Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS)
- Software-as-a-Service(SaaS)


Dafin Exim also faces some of the issues while using on-premise resources which includes long deployment times,scalability,higher costs,Even if they can enjoy the data protection as the biggest advantage,as it must be maintained by company employees and thus costs working time.In traditional,on-premise deployment models,enterprise applications and various IT solutions are commonly hosted on centralized servers and storage devices residing
in the organization's own data center.End-user devices,such as smartphones and laptops,access the data center through the corporate network,which provides uninterrupted internet connectivity.A salient 
cloud feature that applies to end-user functionality is how centralized IT resources can be accessed using the same network protocols regardless of wheather they reside inside or outside of a corporate network. 
For Dafin Exim, I recommended Microsoft Azure cloud provider to solve all their data storage issues and they got convinced about the differences between microsoft azure and on-premise IT resources.
