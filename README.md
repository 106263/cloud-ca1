2. *Current IT setup of the enterprise*

Dafin Exim currently accesses and stores data and applications via local IT resources such as HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). Clear reasons to use on-premises hard drives
Available, affordable and long lasting. As Dafin Exim is a growing company, doing business manually (B2C), cloud storage is not very aware of the benefits of his devices.
Calculations are performed by Tally software. Reducing operating costs and optimizing your IT environment is critical to understanding and comparing the cost models behind deploying on-premises and cloud-based environments.


3. *Recommendations*

Like product wholesalers who buy goods in bulk at low prices, public cloud providers base their business model on bulk procurement.
It will be available to cloud consumers via low-cost leasing packages. This opens the door for companies to
Get access to powerful infrastructure without having to buy it yourself. A cloud delivery model represents a specific pre-packaged IT mix
Resources provided by cloud providers. Three common cloud delivery models have been established and formalized:

- Infrastucture-as-a-Service(IaaS)
- Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS)
- Software-as-a-Service(SaaS)



Dafin Exim additionally faces a number of the problems at the same time as the usage of on-premise resources which incorporates lengthy deployment times,scalability,better prices,Even if they could revel in the information safety as the most important advantage,because it have to be maintained through business 
enterprise personnel and for that reason prices operating time.In traditional,on-premise deployment models,company programs and diverse IT answers are generally hosted on centralized servers and storage devices residing.
withinside the organization's very own data centre.End-user devices,which include smartphones and laptops,get access to the data centre through the company network,which offers uninterrupted net connectivity.A salient
cloud characteristic that applies to end-user capability is how centralized IT resources may be accessed the usage of the same network protocols irrespective of wheather they are living internal or outside of the corporate networks.
For Dafin Exim,In my humble opinion, when they comes to the cloud, it can't beat Microsoft Azure.After all, its cloud-based services are designed specifically for businesses. Organizations can choose to move completely to the cloud or adopt a hybrid approach that
 migrates incrementally from on-premises to the cloud.They were satisfied approximately the variations among microsoft azure and on-premise IT resources.
