# **CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES FOR BUSINESS** #

## *CA1:Cloud Strategy and sample deployment* ##

### Introduction ###

In today's ever-changing business environment, small business owners need access to data and applications from their computer, tablet, or mobile phone.
In the office, in the field, or on the go. Cloud computing provides this location-independent access through an internet connection. How to know cloud computing
The on-demand delivery of computer services such as applications, data storage, and data processing over the Internet. Working in the cloud offers a small offer
Companies enjoy many benefits, including improved collaboration, easier access, and faster turnaround times.

2. *Current IT setup of the enterprise*

Dafin Exim currently accesses and stores data and applications via local IT resources such as HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). Clear reasons to use on-premises hard drives
Available, affordable and long lasting. As Dafin Exim is a growing company, doing business manually (B2C), cloud storage is not very aware of the benefits of his devices.
Calculations are performed by Tally software. Reducing operating costs and optimizing your IT environment is critical to understanding and comparing the cost models behind deploying on-premises and cloud-based environments.


3. *Recommendations*


3.1.*Recommending cloud(Microsoft Azure)*


Like product wholesalers who buy goods in bulk at low prices, public cloud providers base their business model on bulk procurement.
It will be available to cloud consumers via low-cost leasing packages. This opens the door for companies to
Get access to powerful infrastructure without having to buy it yourself. A cloud delivery model represents a specific pre-packaged IT mix
Resources provided by cloud providers. Three common cloud delivery models have been established and formalized:

- Infrastucture-as-a-Service(IaaS)
- Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS)
- Software-as-a-Service(SaaS)



Dafin Exim additionally faces a number of the problems at the same time as the usage of on-premise resources which incorporates lengthy deployment times,scalability,better prices,Even if they could revel in the information safety as the most important advantage,because it have to be maintained through business 
enterprise personnel and for that reason prices operating time.In traditional,on-premise deployment models,company programs and diverse IT answers are generally hosted on centralized servers and storage devices residing.
withinside the organization's very own data centre.End-user devices,which include smartphones and laptops,get access to the data centre through the company network,which offers uninterrupted net connectivity.A salient
cloud characteristic that applies to end-user capability is how centralized IT resources may be accessed the usage of the same network protocols irrespective of wheather they are living internal or outside of the corporate networks.
For Dafin Exim,In my humble opinion, when they comes to the cloud, it can't beat Microsoft Azure.After all, its cloud-based services are designed specifically for businesses. Organizations can choose to move completely to the cloud or adopt a hybrid approach that
 migrates incrementally from on-premises to the cloud.They were satisfied approximately the variations among microsoft azure and on-premise IT resources.

3.2.*Recommending Service levels and deployment type*



The high upfront cost of an on-premise Dafin Exim upgrade suggests that purchasing enough hardware can be  very expensive and difficult
to scale as our demands change moreover On-premises requires dedicated IT support plus on-premises rack space or server room/closet.
For Dafin Exim ,they have to manage applications,data,runtime,middleware,operating systems,virtualization,servers,
storage as well as networking.When it comes to the azure cloud services the only thing they have to manage is  applications and data.All others 
will be processed by azure itself as azure is a Platform as a service(PaaS).For Dafin Exim,I recommended azure virtual machine , **Virtual machine**, 
infrastructure as a service (IaaS) allows users to launch general-purpose Microsoft Windows and Linux virtual machines, as well as pre-configured machine images for popular software packages.
Most users run Linux on Azure, some of the many Linux distributions offered, including Microsoft's own Linux-based Azure Sphere.
Application services, a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) environment for developers to easily publish and manage websites.WebJobs, applications can be deployed in the 
Application Services environment to perform background processing that can be called on a schedule, on demand, or run continuously. The Blob, Table, and Queue services can be used to communicate between WebApps, XYZ, iOS software, and WebJobs, and to provide state.
**Azure Kubernetes Service** (AKS) allows you to quickly deploy a production-ready Kubernetes cluster in Azure. Azure is responsible for the control plane management, and the client has the ability to select/scale the data place(kubernetes worker nodes). 
**Azure Active Directory** is used to synchronize on-premises folders and enable SSO (Single Sign On). AAD's B2C enables the use of consumer identity and access management in the cloud, and domain services used to combine Azure VMs with a domain without domain controllers.
Azure Information Protection can be used to protect sensitive information. Azure Active Directory's external identity is a set of features that enable organizations to collaborate with external users, including customers and partners.
The **storage service** provides a REST API and SDK to store and access data in the cloud.Table services allow programs to store structured text in partitioned collections of entities accessed by partitioning and primary keys.
Azure Table Service is a NoSQL non-relational database. The Blob service allows programs to store unstructured text and binary data as blobs accessible over HTTP(S) paths. The Blob service also provides security mechanisms to control access to data. The queue service allows programs to communicate asynchronously using messages using queues.
